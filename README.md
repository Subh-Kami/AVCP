A comprehensive blockchain-based platform for issuing, managing, and verifying digital credentials on the Avalanche network.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

AVCP addresses the critical problem of credential fraud by providing a decentralized, tamper-proof system for digital credentials. Built on Avalanche's high-performance blockchain, it offers sub-second finality and low transaction costs for credential operations.

## Key Features

- **Immutable Credentials**: NFT-based certificates that cannot be forged
- **Instant Verification**: Real-time credential verification with cryptographic proof
- **Issuer Registry**: Whitelist of approved credential issuers
- **Fast & Cheap**: Leverages Avalanche's sub-second finality and low fees
- **Privacy Options**: Optional encrypted metadata for sensitive information
- **Cross-Chain Ready**: Built with Avalanche ICM compatibility in mind

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Avalanche C-Chain (EVM-compatible)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity with OpenZeppelin libraries
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with Ethers.js
- **Development**: Hardhat/Foundry for testing
- **Wallets**: Core Wallet, MetaMask integration
- **Storage**: IPFS for credential documents
