# 🚀 AVCP GitHub Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Create New GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `avcp-platform` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: `Avalanche Verifiable Credentials Platform - Blockchain-based credential verification system`
4. Set to **Public** (or Private if preferred)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/avcp-platform.git

# Rename the main branch to main (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Push all files to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Set Up GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to host the frontend on GitHub Pages:

1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: main / docs folder
4. Save

### 4. Environment Variables for GitHub Actions

For the CI/CD pipeline to work, add these secrets in GitHub:

1. Go to Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions
2. Add these repository secrets:
   - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your deployment private key
   - `SNOWTRACE_API_KEY`: For contract verification

### 5. Enable GitHub Actions

The repository includes workflows that will:
- Run tests on every push
- Build and test the frontend
- Deploy contracts to testnet (when configured)

## Next Steps After GitHub Deployment

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ Push code to GitHub 
2. ⚙️ Configure environment variables
3. 🔧 Set up branch protection rules
4. 📝 Add collaborators if needed

### Future Enhancements:
1. 🌐 Deploy to Avalanche Fuji Testnet
2. 🎯 Set up automated testing
3. 📊 Add monitoring and analytics
4. 🔐 Implement additional security features

```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get authentication errors:
1. Use GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`
2. Or use SSH instead of HTTPS
3. Or use personal access token

### If the push fails:
1. Check repository name matches
2. Verify you have push permissions
3. Try: `git push --set-upstream origin main`
